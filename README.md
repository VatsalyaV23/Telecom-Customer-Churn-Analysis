# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Project on the Analysis of the Customer Churn in Telecom
To tackle customer turnover and revenue loss, the solution builds a predictive system that identifies telecom users who are likely to churn. The process begins with exploring and understanding customer behavior through rich visual analytics. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, the data is transformed into clear, pattern-revealing plots—usage distributions, contract trends, payment behavior, and service-related factors—helping expose the hidden signals that often precede churn.

These insights guide the development of a machine learning model trained on historical customer records. The model learns relationships between customer attributes and churn outcomes, ultimately generating a churn probability score for each user.

The final system is wrapped in an intuitive Gradio interface, allowing users to input customer details, view model predictions in real time, and interact with the pipeline effortlessly. This makes the tool practical for customer-care teams and decision-makers who need quick, reliable, and interpretable churn predictions.

Overall, the solution empowers telecom providers to act early, engage at-risk customers, and safeguard their revenue.
